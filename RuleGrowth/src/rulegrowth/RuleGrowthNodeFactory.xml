        Implementation of the RuleGrowth Algorithm. <br />  <br />
        The input file format is defined as follows: <br />
        Each item from a sequence is a positive integer and items from the same itemset within a sequence are separated by single space.  <br />
        Note that it is assumed that items within a same itemset are sorted according to a total order and that no item can appear twice in the same itemset. <br />
         The value "-1" indicates the end of an itemset. The value "-2" indicates the end of a sequence (it appears at the end of each String).  <br />
         <br /> For further information see:  <br />
